# IO Buster

IO Buster provides a flexible test framework, which allows characterizing
performance of an NVMe drive. When combined with IO Buster Coordinator, multiple
NVMe drives can be characterized concurrently.

IO Buster leverages the Storage Performance Development Kit
([SPDK](http://www.spdk.io/)) to generate high speed IO traffics to NVMe drives.
